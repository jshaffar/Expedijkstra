Our team plans to meet on Tuesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. We will meet during the evening. The meetings on the weekends will be longer for us to discuss the work we have done throughout the week and cooperate on debugging. The Tuesday meeting will be shorter and is intended for updates on how far we’ve gotten with our tasks. The meetings will be held via Google meets. We do not plan to have minutes unless it seems necessary after a few meetings. Our mode of contact outside of the meetings will be through Whatsapp and we expect to respond to teammates by the next day at the latest. In order to have the input of all teammates be acknowledged, we will make sure to make final decisions with input from all members of the team and we will attempt to incorporate ideas suggested by all team members if possible. We will make sure to not dismiss anyone’s ideas in order to ensure every member is open to sharing their ideas.

During the weekend meetings, we will make a unanimous decision on what tasks each team member will work on. We will make sure that each member works with tasks that they are comfortable with so that they can be as productive as possible. If any complications arise during a task we will attempt to have a meeting to discuss and address the issues and how we should fix it. If that is not possible, we will discuss over Whatsapp how we can distribute the unforeseen work. We hope that each group member will be able to spend 7 hours on the project a week, however, we will be accommodating any time commitments. If a person cannot complete a task due to conflicts, if possible they will make up the time in a later week. Other teammates will also pitch in to get the tasks done. We believe that we can resolve disagreements through discussion and finding a compromise that is acceptable to all parties involved. In the case that a member has not accomplished a task, we will check in with them and find the root of the issue and help in any we can. If a team member is habitually late we will check whether our meeting schedule is not comfortable for that team member and adjust it so our schedule works for everyone.

Find a middle ground where both team members can compromise and be satisfied with the outcome. Offer assistance if their understanding the task and also discuss with said team member why they haven’t contributed enough and how we can help foster more contribution. Ask if the person needs the time of the meeting to be adjusted.
