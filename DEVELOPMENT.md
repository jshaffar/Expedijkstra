# Development of Final Project

## Week 1

We discussed our approach to our algorithm and agreed upon using a BFS. We decided to also use smaller test cases so we started by using the airport data from Greenland. These were the tasks we have done over this week :- 

1.  Mohammed - Turned parsed data into a graph and wrote a class to build subgraphs using different filters. These subgraphs will be used for testing so we have varied datasets for our unit tests. 
2. Jeremy - Built project starter code and parsed data into structs representing airports and routes.
3. Sriram - worked on the BFS, which is still in progress. Possible output functions were also investigated and we have agreed upon giving the airport(s), and the route(s), as our outputs.
