# Development of Final Project

## Week 1

We discussed our approach to our algorithm and agreed upon using a BFS. We decided to also use smaller test cases so we started by using the airport data from Greenland. These were the tasks we have done over this week :- 

1.  Mohammed - Turned parsed data into a graph and wrote a class to build subgraphs using different filters. These subgraphs will be used for testing so we have varied datasets for our unit tests. 
2. Jeremy - Built project starter code and parsed data into structs representing airports and routes.
3. Sriram - worked on the BFS, which is still in progress. Possible output functions were also investigated and we have agreed upon giving the airport(s), and the route(s), as our outputs. 

## Week 2

We implemented Djikras, added weights to graphs, and made progress on graphical output. 

1. Mohammed - Implemented and tested Djikras algorithm, and added weights to graph structure.
2. Jeremy - Worked on graphical output, and projected points from lat longitude form to its counterparts in pixel form.
3. Sririam - Worked on BFS, continued to work on potential optimizations and education about BFS algorithm.

## Week 3

We finished BFS, added a input system and our graphical output is working. 

1. Mohammed - Fixed bugs and worked on input system.
2. Jeremy - Added graphical output for Dijkstra and BFS.
3. Sririam - Finished BFS.
